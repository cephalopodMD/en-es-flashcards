really simple flashcards for my duolingo words because this functionality is maddeningly absent from the app!

copy/pasted and cleaned up the english translations a bit to avoid needing parentheses in answers. allows multiple options if the english translation includes a slash (e.g. "he walks" will match to "he/she/it walks"). Also removed a couple of random errors (e.g. "Áca" is an english translation of áca I guess??).

to run, just open terminal, navigate to the folder you have this in and run `python3 flash.py`
